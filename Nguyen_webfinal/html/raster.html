    <text> <p> This was my pet dog, Maxie, who I decided to base my raster project on. Unfortunately, he passed away in April 2017 at 12 years old, so I did this as a sort of dedication to him. I used song lyrics from Yuna's
        <i>Lullabies</i> because even though it's been a year since he's gone, I'll never really forget him. </p> </text>
