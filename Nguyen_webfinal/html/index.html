    <text><p> My name is <strong> Sif Nguyen </strong>, and I took this class just for fun! I am a Nursing major and my hobby is to create and post my own graphics on Tumblr, so before taking this class I was self-taught on Adobe Photoshop. Initially, I wanted to take this class to be better at the Adobe Photoshop application, but I learned more about the other Adobe applications and HTML/CSS as well. </p> </text>
