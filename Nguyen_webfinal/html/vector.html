    <h1> Gill-man takes a swim </h1>

    <img src="../images/Nguyen_Sif_vector_AIfinal%20.jpg">

    <text> <p> After recently seeing Guillermo Del Toro's <i>The Shape of Water </i> the Gill-man was on my mind as I did my vector project. It was definitely a struggle, as I spent maybe 4 hours using the pen tool trying to draw him. The pen tool is not as versatile as I hoped, so in retrospect I wish I used the brush tool instead. I also originally wanted to animate him, but considering how hard it was to draw in illustrator I wanted to come up with a new idea. </p></text>
