    <text> <p> My initial idea was something a little more complicated, where Wonder Woman glides in from the sky on a pair of robbers in the beginning, then the rest is as seen above. But this beginning scene would take way too long trying to draw in Illustrator, so I settled on just a zoom-in shot of a bank's exterior. In the conceptual process I also wanted to have her arms move with a motion tween but I felt that would look too robotic. It also fits into the mythos that she move so fast to dodge bullets that you wouldn't see it--I also took inspiration from comic panels where she was drawn with her arms in multiple places all at once, in order to portray her fast motion. </p> </text>
